    <p>Here’s to the crazy ones.</p>

    <p>The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.</p>
      
    <p>The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.</p>
    
    <p>They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo.</p>
    
    <p>You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.</p>
      
    <p>But the only thing you can’t do is ignore them.</p>
    
    <p>Because they change things.</p>

    <p>They push the human race forward.</p>

    <p>While some may see them as the crazy ones.</p>
    
    <p>We see genius.</p>
    
    <p>Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.</p>
